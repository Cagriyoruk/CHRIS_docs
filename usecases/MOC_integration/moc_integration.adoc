== Registering to Mass Open Cloud

* In order to create an account, you should submit a request to MOC. It usually takes 2-3 business days to get approved. + 
Follow this link -> https://massopen.cloud/request-an-account/[Request Account on MOC]

* Learn more about adding users to your Openstack project. Follow this link -> https://support.massopen.cloud/kb/faq.php?id=22[Add Users to Openstack Project]

* If your access is approved, Follow these links to login to the Openshift and Openstack platforms -> https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443/[Openshift] | http://kaizen.massopen.cloud/[Openstack]

You should be able to login to these platforms by using your `SSO` credentials.


== Adding Projects to Openshift and Openstack

In order to create new projects on Openshift and Openstack you can create a ticket here -> https://osticket.massopen.cloud/[Create a Ticket]

If the projects are created, you should be able to login and view the projects.

Use your `SSO` credentials to login to https://kaizen.massopen.cloud to view your project in Openstack. (See the image below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Openstack-project.png[Openstack Project]

Use your `SSO` credentials to login to https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443 to view your project in Openshift. (See the image below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Openshift-project.png[Openshift Project]

You can create a project manually in the Openshift UI or by using a terminal command:

....
$ oc new-project cs6620-sp2021-integrated-med-ai --display-name="CS6620 Spring 2021 \
Integrating Medical AI Compute CPU/GPU worklows on the MOC -- PowerPC and x86-64 -- Using OpenShift"
....

Note: Make sure that you have OC libraries installed on your system. (See xref:#installing-openshift-cli-tool[Installing Openshift CLI Tool]
)

== Installing Openshift CLI Tool

It is recommended to install the Openshift CLI Tool on your system to ease the next steps working on MOC platform smoothly.

=== Recommended Method

In order to download the Openshift CLI Tool, you will have to create/open a RedHat account. This method is reccomended in order to get the most up to date OC libraries.

Follow this link to get information on how to download and install the Openshift CLI Tool -> https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Download Openshift CLI Tool]

=== Alternative Method (Deprecated)

If you do not wish to create a RedHat account, you can download the packages from this GitHub repo: https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases

== Creating Secrets on Openshift Using CLI Tool

After succesfully installing Openshift CLI Tool, you can login to Opeshift using CLI commands.

First go to https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443/[Openshift] and login using `SSO` credentials. After that click `Copy Login Command` as seen from the image below. 

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Openshift-login.png[Openshift Login]

Open a terminal and paste the login command. (Your token will differ from the example)

....
$ oc login https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443 --token=MQCsXU6Gs1DWNE0zk67eYA0A7eCmH0-cM576qZooRFY
....

=== Creating Secrets

==== Create `kubecfg`

....
oc project myproject
oc create secret generic kubecfg --from-file=$HOME/.kube/config -n myproject
....

==== Create `pfioh_config & pman_config`

["loweralpha", start=1]
. Create a file `example-config.cfg` and add the following:

....
[AUTH TOKENS]
token = password
....

["loweralpha", start=2]
. Convert the configuration to base64 & copy the base64 encoded results with the following command:

....
cat example-config.cfg | base64
....

["loweralpha", start=3]
. Create a file `example-secret.yml` and add the encoded result (For `pfioh`):

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pfioh-config
type: Opaque
data:
  pfioh_config.cfg: <base64 encoded configuration>
....

["loweralpha", start=4]
. Create the secret for `pfioh`

....
oc create -f example-secret.yml
....

["loweralpha", start=5]
. Edit the file example-secret.yml and add the following (For `pman`):

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pman-config
type: Opaque
data:
  pman_config.cfg: <base64 encoded configuration>
....

["loweralpha", start=6]
. Create the secret for `pman`

....
oc create -f example-secret.yml
....

==== Create `swift-credentials`

["loweralpha", start=1]
. Create a file swift-credentials.cfg and add the following:

....
[AUTHORIZATION]
osAuthUrl          = https://kaizen.massopen.cloud:13000/v3

[SECRET]
applicationId      = <Follow the below steps to generate applicationId>
applicationSecret  = <Follow the below steps to generate applicationSecret>
....

Follow these steps to create and `applicationId` and `applicationSecret` for the Openstack project:

....
    1) Visit the identity panel at https://onboarding.massopen.cloud/identity/
    2) Click the "+ Create Application Credential" button
    3) In the follow dialog, give your credential a name. You can leave the other fields blank.
    4) Click "Create Application Credential"
    5) This will present a window with an ID and secret. Record these values because you won't be able to retrieve them after closing the window.
....

["loweralpha", start=2]
. Create the secret `swift-credentials`

....
oc create secret generic swift-credentials --from-file=<path-to-file>/swift-credentials.cfg
....

If all the steps above went well, you should be able to see the secrets that were created succesfully

....
(chris_env) [cyoruk@localhost ChRISWORK]$ oc get secrets

== Deploying pfioh on Openshift

Follow this link to download `pfioh` -> https://github.com/FNNDSC/pfioh

After downloading it, enter the subdirectory `openshift`:

....
cd pfioh/openshift
....

To deploy `pfioh` on Openshift we need a file that contains all the information about the service we're going to deploy which is `pfioh-openshift-template.json`. 

For deploying `pfioh` to Openshift:

....
oc new-app pfioh-openshift-template.json
....

After deploying `pfioh`, you can see it deployed and running on Openshift. (See image below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Pfioh-Overview.png[Pfioh Overview]

To delete `pfioh`

....
oc delete all -l app=pfioh
oc delete route pfioh
....

=== Deploying your own version of `pfioh` 

If you want to deploy your own version of `pfioh` you can edit `pfioh-openshift-template.json` which is present in pfioh/openshift. You will find a line containing "image": "fnndsc/pfioh", which is basically the name of the docker image we want to deploy. As an example you can change it to sandip117/pfioh. So it would look like "image": "sandip117/pfioh". (See the image below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Pfioh-template.png[Pfioh Template]

*Note:* The current version that supports `SSO` is `fnndsc/pfioh`

== Deploying pman on Openshift

Follow this link to download `pman` -> https://github.com/FNNDSC/pman

After downloading it, enter the subdirectory `openshift`:

....
cd pman/openshift
....

*Note:* The current version that supports `SSO` is `fnndsc/pman:2.2.4`. There are 2 places in the template where you need to change your project name. Look for a field saying OPENSHIFTMGR_PROJECT

Now edit the `pman-openshift-template.json present` with your OPENSHIFT project name and updated pman docker image (See image below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Pman-template.png[Pman Template]

To deploy `pman` on Openshift we need a file that contains all the information about the service we're going to deploy which is `pman-openshift-template.json`. 

For deploying `pman` to Openshift:

....
oc new-app pman-openshift-template.json
....

After deploying `pman`, you can see it deployed and running on Openshift. (See image below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/Pman-Overview.png[Pman Overview]

To delete `pman`

....
oc delete all -l app=pman
oc delete route pman
oc delete cronjob pman-reaper
....

== Running Test Scripts on Openshift

There are a couple of prerequisites that we have to satisfy before running any plugins on Openshift.

* xref:#create-a-python-virtual-environment[Create a Python Virtual Environment]

* xref:#install-pfurl[Install pfurl]

* xref:#download-test-scripts[Download test scripts]

=== Create a Python Virtual Environment

["arabic", start=1]
. Install the Python virtual environment creator

* For Fedora -> `sudo dnf install python3-virtualenv`

* For Ubuntu -> `sudo apt install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper python3-tk`

["arabic", start=2]
. Create a directory for your virtual environments

....
mkdir ~/python-envs
....

["arabic", start=3]
. Add these two lines to your .bashrc file

....
export WORKON_HOME=~/python-envs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
....

["arabic", start=4]
. Source your .bashrc and create a new Python3 virtual env

....
source .bashrc
mkvirtualenv --python=python3 chris_env
....

["arabic", start=5]
. Activate your virtual environment

....
workon chris_env
....

*Note:* To deactivate the virtual environment you can use `deactivate` command on the terminal

=== Install pfurl

If you cretad the python virtual environment succesfully, you can install pfurl

....
pip install pfurl
....

=== Download Test Scripts

You can download the test scripts from https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS-E2E

*Note:* Sometimes, you can get an invalid response like 502 or 401 error when you execute the scripts. To resolve this is add `--authToken password` to each of the scripts that you want to execute.

Example:

....
}' --quiet --jsonpprintindent 4 --authToken password
....

=== Running the Scripts

If you've succesfully completed all the prerequisites, you can start running the test scripts. First off, you need the routes of the services you deployed to run the scripts. 

....
(chris_env) [cyoruk@localhost scripts]$ oc get routes

== (Additional Step) Building a Local Openshift Cluster

Note: This step is focused on bringing a minimal `OpenShift 4.x` cluster to your local laptop or desktop computer. If you are looking for a solution for running `OpenShift 3.x` , you will need tools such as oc cluster up, https://github.com/minishift/minishift[Minishift] or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview[CDK].

This additional step is helpful for people who build ChRIS plugins/services to test/debug applications locally before testing it on the cloud environment.

There are couple steps involved to build a local `Openshift 4.x` cluster.

* xref:#download-codeready-containers[Download CodeReady Containers]

* xref:#install-codeready-containers[Install CodeReady Containers]

=== Download CodeReady Containers

Select your OS and Download CodeReady Containers binaries with an embedded OpenShift disk image from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/create/local[CodeReady Containers] (See Image Below)

image::https://github.com/Cagriyoruk/CHRIS_docs/blob/master/images/mpc/CodeReady-Containers.png[CodeReady Containers]


After downloading CodeReady containers, extract it and place the executable in your `$PATH` (You can check your `$PATH` with `$ echo $PATH`)

....
$ tar -xf crc-linux-amd64.tar.xz (Extract CodeReady Containers)
$ cp -r crc-linux-amd64 $PATH (Place the executable in one of your $PATH)
....

You need to Download or copy your pull secret. The install program will prompt you for your pull secret during installation.

Note: In order to download the CodeReady Containers, you will have to create/open a RedHat account.

=== Install CodeReady Containers

CodeReady Containers requires the libvirt and NetworkManager packages to run on Linux. Consult the following code block to find the command used to install these packages for your Linux distribution:

* Fedora -> `sudo dnf install NetworkManager`

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS -> `su -c 'yum install NetworkManager'`

* Debian/Ubuntu -> `sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon libvirt-daemon-system network-manager`

Set up the CodeReady Containers. We're going to use the `Pull Secret` that we copied from the CodeReady Container page.

....
$ crc setup
....

Start the CodeReady Containers virtual machine:

....
$ crc start
....

Login to the Openshift Cluster as a developer:

....
$ oc login -u developer https://api.crc.testing:6443
....

=== Deploying `pfioh` and `pman`

Deploying `pfioh` and `pman` to local Openshift cluster is the same with deploying it on MOC. You can follow the referenced headers to deploy them.

* Create a new project in the local Openshift cluster

....
oc new-project local-chris
....

* xref:#deploying-pman-on-openshift[Deploying pman on Openshift]

== Troubleshoot Errors

=== HTTP 400 Bad Request

This indicates that the server couldn't understand the request due to invalid syntax. Check Openshift logs to find out the exact issue.

=== HTTP 401 Unauthorized

If you're getting an HTTP 401 error, there are couple things you can do.

["arabic", start=1]
. Double check your `swift-credentials` secret is to see if it's missing anything.

["arabic", start=2]
. Add `--authToken password` at the of the script that your trying to run.

["arabic", start=3]
. Double check if the `auid` is correct in the script.

["arabic", start=4]
. Recreate secret kubecfg (Every time you log in you need to recreate the kubecfg)

=== HTTP 409 Conflict

If your getting a HTTP 409 error, it's likely that you already have a same jid(job id). Check Openshift storage to see if there are existing persistent storage. If yes, you can delete it and run the application again.
