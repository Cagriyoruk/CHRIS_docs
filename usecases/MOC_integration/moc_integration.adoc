== Registering to Mass Open Cloud
In order to get an account from MOC, you should submit an account request. Follow this link -> https://massopen.cloud/request-an-account/[Request Account on MOC]

If you want to learn more about adding users to your Openstack project, follow this link -> https://support.massopen.cloud/kb/faq.php?id=22[Add Users to Openstack Project]

If your access is approved, Follow these links to login to the Openshift and Openstack platforms -> https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443/[Openshift] | http://kaizen.massopen.cloud/[Openstack]

You should be able to login to these platforms by using your `SSO` credentials.


== Adding Projects to Openshift and Openstack
In order to create new projects on Openshift and Openstack you can create a ticket here -> https://osticket.massopen.cloud/[Create a Ticket]

If the projects are created, you should be able to login and view the projects.

Use your `SSO` credentials to login to https://kaizen.massopen.cloud to view your project in Openstack. (See the image below)

You can create a project manually in the Openshift UI or by using a terminal command:

....
$ oc new-project cs6620-sp2021-integrated-med-ai --display-name="CS6620 Spring 2021 \
Integrating Medical AI Compute CPU/GPU worklows on the MOC -- PowerPC and x86-64 -- Using OpenShift"
....

Note: Make sure that you have OC libraries installed on your system. (See xref:#installing-openshift-cli-tool[Installing Openshift CLI Tool]
)

== Installing Openshift CLI Tool
It is recommended to install the Openshift CLI Tool on your system to ease the next steps working on MOC platform smoothly.

=== Recommended Method

In order to download the Openshift CLI Tool, you will have to create/open a RedHat account. This method is reccomended in order to get the most up to date OC libraries.

Follow this link to get information on how to download and install the Openshift CLI Tool -> https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Download Openshift CLI Tool]

=== Alternative Method (Deprecated)

If you do not wish to create a RedHat account, you can download the packages from this GitHub repo: https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases

== Creating Secrets on Openshift Using CLI Tool
After succesfully installing Openshift CLI Tool, you can login to Opeshift using CLI commands.

First go to https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443/[Openshift] and login using `SSO` credentials. After that click `Copy Login Command` as seen from the image below.

....
$ oc login https://k-openshift.osh.massopen.cloud:8443 --token=MQCsXU6Gs1DWNE0zk67eYA0A7eCmH0-cM576qZooRFY
....

=== Creating Secrets

oc project myproject
oc create secret generic kubecfg --from-file=$HOME/.kube/config -n myproject
....


. Create `pfioh_config & pman_config`

. Create `swift-credentials`
